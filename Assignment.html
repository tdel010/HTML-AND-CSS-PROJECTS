			<h1>Types of mountain bikes</h1>
				<p>There are many different types of mountain bikes, and this can be confusing to new riders. This page will help you understand the different types of mountain bikes you may hear about.The bike classifications are arranged in order from the least agressive to the most aggressive type of riding.</p>
			<h3>Cross country (XC) bikes</h3>
				<p>Cross country or XC bikes, are the lightest and nimblest type of mountain bikes. While modern XC bikes can handle some difficult terrain, their main purpose is to cover ground quickly on relatively mellow terrain. Since they are the lightest type of mountain bike, they are also the easiest to ride when it comes to ascending long climbs. XC bikes tend to have steeper headtube angles and less suspension travel than other, more aggressive types of bikes. Pro XC riders are sometimes known as "dirt roadies" since they often have shaved legs and wear tight lycra like road cyclists.</p>

			<h3>Trail bikes</h3>
				<p>Trail bikes are the next class of bikes in terms of riding aggressive trails. A good trail bike can handle most terrain, although it may be slower and less comfortable on aggressive terrain than some of the other classes of bikes. For a lot of riders, trail bikes are the sweet spot: They pedal well, if not as efficiently as XC bikes, and they can handle most of the terrain riders are likely to encounter. They typically have more suspension travel and more durable components than XC bikes.</p>
			<h4>Here is a link to a popular trail bike.</h4>
				<a href="https://www.backcountry.com/ibis-ripmo-gx-axs-transmission-mountain-bike">Ibis Ripmo Trail Bike</a>
			<blockquote style=font-style: italic;">The Ibis Ripmo V3 is the most impressive, aggressive trail bike we've ever tested. A 64.5 head tube angle, longer wheelbase, and updated kinematics give the bike an intrepid feel without robbing it of its renowned agility. The Ripmo is wildly confident and capable in aggressive terrain and ultra-high speeds. Like its predecessor, the bike maintains its mythical climbing abilities, adept low-speed handling, and maneuverability in tight, technical terrain.</blockquote>
