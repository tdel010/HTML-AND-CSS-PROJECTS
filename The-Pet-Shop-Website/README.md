# Keyboard shortcuts — Suggestions

This workspace includes two quick shortcuts to help you manage and access editor suggestions.

- `Ctrl+Alt+Space` — Show suggestions immediately (same as `Trigger Suggest`).
- `Ctrl+Alt+S` — Open the workspace `settings.json` quickly so you can toggle suggestion settings.

Files to know in this workspace:

- `.vscode/settings.json` — workspace settings that currently disable quick/inline suggestions.
- `notes/disable-suggestions.md` — quick reference with re-enable steps.

If you change settings and they don't appear to take effect, run `Developer: Reload Window` from the Command Palette.
